Previously, I have been in system management/system admin on platforms based on Open VMS, Linux and Unix. The work became less interesting as time went by and it didn't provide me career growth.  I have been keen to learn new technologies and web development & coding interested me. I did a switchover by doing the twelve weeks intensive coding bootcamp at Makers Academy, London.

I am looking forward to begin my new career as a junior developer in an environment where I can contribute and improve on my newly acquired skills and also get to build new skills learning other technologies.

My past experience gives me technical skills in areas such as shell scripting, DCL, PL/SQL and Relational Databases.
