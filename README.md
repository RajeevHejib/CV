## Rajeev Hejib

###### Available for working full time as a Junior Developer in London and around.

Previously, I have been working on operating systems management on platforms based on Open VMS, Linux and Unix. The work became less interesting as time went by. I have always been keen to learn new technologies.  Web development & coding interested me very much. My extensive search culminated at deciding to do the twelve weeks intensive coding bootcamp at Makers Academy, London.

Now that I have successfully completed the course, I am looking forward to begin my new career as a junior developer in an environment where I can contribute and make a difference.  As I go along I intend to improve on my newly acquired skills and also get to develop more skills learning other technologies.


## Skills

##### Software Development

At Makers Academy I was introduced to the the most used technologies in today's web development. I learnt about the best practices in software development, pair programing and the principles of test driven development.

Some of the projects I did were developed using Ruby, Javascript and used frameworks like Sinatra, Ruby on Rails also the databases such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB.  For testing I learned using Rspec, Capybara, Karma and Protractor.

Here are some of my code samples:
 [Chitter:](https://github.com/RajeevHejib/chitter-challenge) - A twitter clone, [RPS (Rock, Paper, Scissors):](https://github.com/RajeevHejib/rps-challenge) - A web bases Rock, Paper, Scissors game,  [Instagram:](https://github.com/RajeevHejib/instagram-challenge) - A clone of Instagram and  [ToDo:](https://github.com/RajeevHejib/todo_challenge) A to-do web application developed using AngularJS and tested with Karma and Protractor

[SofAR:](https://github.com/djtango/furniture-app)  Was my final project.  This was an android based application.  This  is a furniture placement tool based on the principles of augmented reality.  For this project I learned a completely new set of technologies that we didn't learn during the previous weeks of the course.  These were Android Studio, Java, Javascript, Wikitude-mobile focused AR SDK.  In addition we used HTML and CSS.

##### System Management

Most of my past working experience consists of operating systems support. I am well versed with OpenVMS, Linux and Unix environments.  I am proficient in server build, user support to performance tuning techniques. Most of my work has been on OpenVMS.  I have supported large setups for clients like HP, Centrica, RAC, Alcatel-Lucent etc. I also have working knowledge on shell scripting, DCL scripting and hardware emulators like Charon and AVT.

##### Application Support

I began my career in IT as a programmer.  In my early years I coded in COBOL, Pascal and C.  But with time I switched to activities which were more around application support.  During this time I gained experience on Oracle Databases and related tools such as Oracle Forms, Report writer etc.
