## Rajeev Hejib

Previously, I have been working on system management/system admin on platforms based on Open VMS, Linux and Unix. The work became less interesting as time went by. I have always been keen to learn new technologies.  Web development & coding interested me very much. My extensive search culminated at deciding to do the twelve weeks intensive coding bootcamp at Makers Academy, London.

Now that I have successfully completed the course, I am looking forward to begin my new career as a junior developer in an environment where I can contribute and make a difference.  As I go along I intend to improve on my newly acquired skills and also get to develop more skills learning other technologies.

My past experience may not be as relevant but I am sure it gives me added technical skills.
